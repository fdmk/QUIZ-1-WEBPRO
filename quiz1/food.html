                <h2>Blitar Pecel Rice</h2>
                Although in terms of appearance itâ€™s like the pecel that many Indonesian usually encounter, a matter of taste is certainly 
                different. The taste of  Blitar pecel is more savory and not too sweet. The nuts are also smoother so they have a soft texture. 
                The aroma of lime leaves is strong enough that it will increase your appetite. The more delicious it is with the addition 
                of anchovies and peanut brittle on top.
