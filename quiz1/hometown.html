            <p><span class="first">Blitar</span> is my hometown. Blitar is a small city in East Java, Indonesia, about 73 km from Malang and 
                167 km from Surabaya. The city is noted as the location of the grave of Sukarno, the first President of Indonesia.
                Blitar also known from it's PETA revolt (Pemberontakan PETA).
                PETA revolt was an anti-occupation revolt in present-day Indonesia, which took place on 14 February 1945
                by the PETA daidan (battalion) in Blitar. This revolt was widely known as the first major uprising of local armies
                in Indonesia during the Japanese occupation. The revolt ended unsuccessfully, where most of the rebels left the attack,
                or were captured or killed by the Japanese. Nevertheless, the government of Indonesia acknowledged the revolt as a 
                meaningful revolution.
            </p>
            <p> Blitar is also the hometown of many famous people, like Boediono (Former Vice President of Indonesia),
                Admiral Agus Suhartono (Former commander-in-chief of the Indonesian military), Anjasmara (Actor), Hengky Kurniawan (Actor), etc.
                Despite Blitar is a small city, not as famous as it's neighbour Kediri or Malang, Blitar city and regency has a wide
                area in total. It also has many travel attractions such as beautiful nature views, authentic traditional foods, original
                cultures, historic buildings, even wonderful landmarks. If you wanna know it better, you can check out my page about Blitar's
